    <p> Almost 4 years ago I became a mother to an amazing little girl. She was born to parents who were in jail and now serving double life in prision. At the time I was married and a happy housewife. Fast forward 9 months and we divorced because of all the legal issues we faced with her guardianship. We moved in with my parents and I found a job that I  loved. Fast forward again to four months ago and I became very ill and was put on disability then ended up losing my job because they could not hold my position any longer. Depression set in and I needed to find somethign to do for a job that would allow me to work and provide a life for my child that she deserves. A friend said to look into tech and I found BitWise online. I sent an email to Terry and met with her. She showed me how to get started with teaching my self to code and got me registered for the course. I am here to make a difference in my life, in the life of my daughter and maybe with any luck be a part of this amazing technology growth here in my home town.</p>
